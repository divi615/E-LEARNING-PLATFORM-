# DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK

The e-learning platform is designed to offer an engaging and interactive learning experience. It features a clean, responsive interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring that users can easily browse and explore various online courses. Upon visiting the platform, users are presented with a course listing page, displaying course titles and progress bars that track the completion of each course. The platform allows users to select a course, where they are directed to a detailed course page containing a list of lessons. Each lesson has an embedded video, typically hosted on platforms like YouTube, and provides an easy way for users to engage with the content. One of the core features of the platform is its progress tracking system. As users progress through lessons, their completion status is reflected in the corresponding progress bar. This allows learners to visually track their progress and stay motivated. The progress bars are updated in real time as users complete lessons, giving them an immediate view of how much of the course they have finished. The design of the platform is fully responsive, meaning it adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from large desktop monitors to mobile devices. This makes the platform accessible and usable across a wide range of devices. The user interface is interactive, with JavaScript ensuring smooth transitions between course details and lessons, as well as the ability to mark lessons as complete. The platform is also designed with scalability in mind, meaning it can easily be extended with features like user authentication, backend integration, and advanced course structures. Overall, this e-learning platform provides an intuitive and motivating learning environment where users can easily navigate through courses, track their progress, and engage with video content, all while benefiting from a design that adapts to their device of choice. Whether for learning new skills or improving existing ones, this platform delivers a strong foundation for a rich, interactive online learning experience.
